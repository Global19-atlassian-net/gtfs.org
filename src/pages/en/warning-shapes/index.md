| Stop does not match ```shape_dist_traveled``` value | This warning is caused by an incorrect ```shape_dist_traveled``` value that does not match the location of the stop along the shape. In some cases, the system can ignore the shape_dist_traveled value and match the stop to the shape; review the problem instances nevertheless. <br><br> It may be a good idea to completely remove the shape_dist_traveled values.              <br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Stop too far from shape                       | This warning can be caused by wrong shapes or wrong stop locations. The problem instances should be reviewed to verify that the shape matches the course of the corresponding trip.A stop was found in the ```stop_times.txt``` file that was more than 150 meters away from the trip path of travel as defined by the shape entry in the ```shapes.txt``` file. This warning can be caused by wrong shape definition or wrong stop locations. <br><br>Review problem instances to verify that the shape matches the course of the corresponding trip and that all stop locations are correct. |
