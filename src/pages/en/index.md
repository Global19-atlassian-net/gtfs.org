## GTFS: Making Public Transit Data Universally Accessible

The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a data specification that allows public transit agencies to publish their transit data in a format that can be consumed by a [wide variety of software applications](/applications). Today, the GTFS data format is used by thousands of public transport providers. 

Historically, TriMet worked with Google to format their transit data into an easily maintainable and consumable format that could be imported into Google Maps.


### Involved organisations

Several organisations are involved in the development and improvement of GTFS:

- [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/)   
- [TriMet](https://trimet.org/)
- [Trillium Transit](https://trilliumtransit.com/gtfs/gtfs-manager/)
- [Google Transit](https://support.google.com/transitpartners/answer/1111471?hl=en&ref_topic=3521043)
- [Conveyal](https://www.conveyal.com/transit-data-tools)

### Our Goal 

This website is meant help people to implement GTFS applications by providing answers to:
 - Non-technical persons who are looking to gain a comprehensive understanding of the GFTS file system
 - Developers looking for technical introduction to the GFTS
 - Developers looking for answers to specific technical issues
 - Developers intending to make specification change proposals
 
### gtfs.org in details
 
GTFS is split into a [static component](/reference/static/) that contains schedule, fare, and geographic transit information and a [real-time component](reference/realtime/v2) that contains arrival predictions, vehicle positions and service advisories.

The specification is detailed in the section ["Documentation"] (/documentation/).

[Examples of datasets](/datasets/) as well as [tutorials and tools](/guides/) are available on this website.  

Also, since GTFS is a community driven data format, online support is available. There exist GitHub issues, group chats and slack channels that are made to ease exchange of opinions on the GTFS matter by users.
It is also possible to  vote on changes to GTFS on these groups.
