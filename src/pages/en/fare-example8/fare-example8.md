# Example 8: Influence of transfers and transfer_duration

<hr> 

The following is an example of a transfer:

* Trip 1 departs at 10:00 and arrives at 11:00.
* Trip 2 departs at 11:15 and arrives at 12:00.
* To make the fare valid for the complete journey, you must allow for at least 1 transfer and 
a ```transfer_duration``` of at least 2 hours (from 10:00 to 12:00).
