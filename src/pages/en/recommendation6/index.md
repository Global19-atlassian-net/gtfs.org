# Vehicle position feeds minimum specification

Google Transit allows you to use realtime (RT) data over General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) static by adding vehicle positions data in your feed. Vehicle position provides Transit users with updates on the 
location of a vehicle, allowing users to plan their trips more efficiently. This article lists the minimum requirements for a working feed of vehicle positions.

## How it works    

Before you create a GTFS-realtime feed, you need to have a working GTFS static feed. After youâ€™ve created a working GTFS static feed, you can sign up to share your RT feed to show users your vehicle positions. 

In order for vehicle positions to show accurate arrival and departure estimates, we require, at minimum, the list of fields shown below:

A GTFS feed, which contains static transit information, is composed of a number of text (.txt) files that are contained in a single ZIP file. Each file describes a particular aspect of transit information: stops, routes, 
trips, fares, etc. For more information about each file, consult the [GTFS reference](/reference/static/). 

In order to create a GTFS feed follow the steps below.

| Field name                  | Required? | Description                                                                    |

| ```entity_id```             | Yes       | Keep this stable until trip is updated                                         |

| ```trip_id```               | Yes       | Uniquely identifies a trip from the static                                     |
| ```start_time```            | Yes       | Required for frequency-based trips                                             |
| ```start_date```            | Yes       | Required for frequency-based trips                                             |
| ```schedule_relationship``` | Yes       | SCHEDULED or other appropriate                                                 |
| ```position```              | Yes       | (maps_transit.Position)                                                        |
| ```latitude```              | Yes       | Degrees north in the WGS-84 coordinate system                                  |
| ```longitude```             | Yes       | Degrees east in the WGS-84 coordinate system                                   |
| ```bearing```               | Optional  | Might be used in the future                                                    |

## Example code

```
entity {   
  id: "entity_id"        

  vehicle: {     
   
     trip: {       
        trip_id: "270856"
        start_time: "09:42:00"        
        start_date: "20170313"
        schedule_relationship: SCHEDULED  
     }

     position: {   
        latitude : -32.92627
        longitude: 151.78036
        bearing  : 91.0   
        speed    : 9.8     
     }
     timestamp: 1527621931  
     vehicle: {    
        id   : "bus-234"  
     }
  }
}
