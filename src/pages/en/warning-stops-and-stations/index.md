| Stops too close / Stations too close <br><br>    | <br><br>Ideally, a real-world stop should be represented by only one stop in the GTFS feed. However, in some schedule and routing systems, the same real-world stop is handled with different internal codes and defined in the feed multiple times. <br>Review these warnings to make sure they are not caused by bad stop locations or bad stop or station modeling. Stops with different names that are too close together can also indicate a problem.  <br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Stops too close together <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                | The system returns this message when it finds two stops in file stops.txt that are very close to each other. This warning often implies that the stops are duplicates. <br> - When two stops are very close, there is a good chance they actually represent the same stop. <br> - Stops with different names that are too close to one another can also indicate a problem. <br> - Stops which are close but on different levels may also trigger this warning. <br> <br>Although this warning is common, it does not necessarily block the launch. The trip planner uses stop location in determining where to place a stop icon marker on the map. The marker represents the physical location where a passenger boards. <br> Schedule and routing systems sometimes use different internal codes (defined multiple times in the GTFS feed) for the same stop. We recommend that you consolidate internal codes into a single stop location code for each unique geolocation to allow placement of a single map marker on that point. <br><br>However, ideally a real-world stop should be represented by only one stop inside the GTFS feed. <br> Review these warnings to make sure they are not caused by bad stop locations or incorrect stop modeling.    <br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Stop too close to station     <br><br><br>           | <br><br>Validation found a stop in the stops.txt file that is more than 100 meters but less than 1000 meters from its parent station, as linked through the parent_station column. The stop may not actually be part of the parent station complex. Subway entrances can be far away from the center of the corresponding station. In this case, you can ignore the warning. <br><br>Review these warnings to make sure they are not caused by bad stop locations or by bad stop or station modeling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Stop unused / station unused  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>           | <br>Stops that are not used by any trip in the feed won’t be processed further. We recommend that you check that unused stop or station entities are intended and not caused by a problem in the feed. <br>A validation warning about unused stops or stations in a GTFS feed indicates that there are entries in the ```stops.txt``` file that are not used by any entries in the ```stop_times.txt``` file. That means that no transit vehicles are scheduled to use that stop or station. While there is no restriction about including in your GTFS feed stops or stations that are not served by any transit vehicles, GTFS providers are encouraged to leave these entities out of their feeds since such entries might confuse riders if, for example, they are shown on a map or included in search results. <br>Here are some things to check when resolving "Unused stop" or "Unused station" validation warnings: <br> - If transit vehicles should be scheduled to use that stop or station, it may indicate a problem with entries in the ```stop_times.txt``` file, such as the stop being incorrectly excluded from the trip or stop pattern of a route.<br> - If the stop or station is no longer in service, it may be best to remove it from the feed. <br> - If using stop-station hierarchy in a GTFS feed, then station entries (stops with a ```location_type``` of 1) typically do not have corresponding entries in the ```stop_times.txt``` file. <br> - If a station entry is not correctly annotated with the proper ```location_type``` value, the feed validator considers it a regular stop and warns that it is unused. |
| <br>Un-merged stop warnings <br><br><br>                 | <br><br>Un-merged stop warnings occur when stops should have been merged. Duplicate stops are confusing for users. <br> The easiest way to fix this is: <br>  __1.__ Review the warning output to identify which stops need to be merged ("problem stop"). <br> __2.__ Find the geocodes of all problem stops in the new feed. <br>__3.__ Update the geocodes of problem stops in the old feed to match the new feed. <br>Assuming there are few stops with this problem, you can manually perform these updates.|
