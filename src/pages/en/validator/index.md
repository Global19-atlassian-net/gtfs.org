# Feed Issues

Review your GTFS feed to identify and address errors and warnings. [This table] (/feed-issues-details/) shows issues that can arise in your data feed.

# Validation Warnings


Validation warnings are informational messages that indicate potential problems with your feed, some of which could prevent your transit data from being displayed to transit data consumers. 
Review warnings to ensure that your feed data is accurate and correctly coded. Where warnings indicate problems, update and then re-validate the feed.

## Warning organised by category:

- [Fares] (/warning-fares/)
- [Frequencies] (/warning-frequencies/)
- [Routes] (/warning-routes/)
- [Service date and times] (/warning-service-dates-and-times/)
- [Shapes] (/warning-shapes/)
- [Stops and stations] (/warning-stops-and-stations/) 
- [Time] (/reference/static/#agencytxt)
- [Transfers] (/warning-transfers/)
- [Trips] (/warning-trips/) 

# Validation Errors

Validation errors are critical, blocking issues that prevent your feed to be correctly processed until you fix them.

[Examples of validation errors are available here] (/validation-errors/)
