## Espanol What is GTFS?

The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is an open transit data standard that

- Contains schedule, fare and geographic transit information
- Has a real-time component containing arrival predictions, vehicle positions and service advisories
- Is used by thousands of public transport providers
- Is consumed by hundreds of [software applications](/applications)

This site includes GTFS documentation, best practices, examples and links to resources and tools. To start creating your own GTFS feed, see the [getting started](/getting-started) section. Information about the benefits of high quality GTFS data can be found [here](http://transitcenter.org/publications/transit_data/). 

The GTFS specification is not set in stone. Users can propose changes to [GTFS-realtime](/realtime/change-process/) or [GTFS-static](/change-process).
